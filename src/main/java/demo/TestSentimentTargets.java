//        String example = "Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumour in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames air pollution for the tumour. The film, which combines footage of a lecture with interviews and factory visits, has been compared with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in both its style and likely impact. The film openly criticises state-owned energy companies, steel producers and coal factories, as well as showing the inability of the Ministry of Environmental Protection to act against the big polluters.\n" +
//                "\n" +
//                "Despite demonstrating the failure of China's regulations on pollution, the Chinese government at first did not censor the film. Instead, the People's Daily reposted the film alongside an interview with Chai, while Chen Jining, the recently appointed minister for environmental protection, praised the film, comparing its significance with Silent Spring, the 1962 book by US environmentalist Rachel Carson. However, within a week, the Communist Partyâ€™s publicity department confidentially ordered the film to be removed. An employee of China Business News was suspended for leaking the order.";

//        String example =    "Recently moved here with my girlfriend and we have found that it is quite manageable. Here's our solution:" +
//                "Use an air quality app. We use the one for http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/. I just have a widget on my Android phone that says the current AQI from the nearest measuring station. Our house rule is to use masks when it's 200+, although my girlfriend often does it from 150+. Anyway, just make your own rule and stick to it." +
//                "Bought some 3M 95N-rated face masks for smoggy days. Just keep one in my bag at all times as the wind can direction and smoggify the nicest days in a couple of hours sometimes. You can get some nice re-usable masks where you can change the filter too." +
//                "We also got two Xiaomi air purifiers that work quite well. They are smartphone-connected and always on, except when we're out during weekdays. The app allows you to check the latest PM2.5 index inside your flat and automate the purifiers." +
//                "Before you go, familiarise yourself with the air quality in your own area so you have a means of comparison. If you live in a city (e.g. Copenhagen) you might be surprised that some days it can actually be quite polluted in Western cities too. I sure was (I come from Copenhagen, Denmark). Of course, Western cities usually don't have those crazy smog days." +
//                "Don't worry too much. Sometimes there's no smog for a whole week, sometime's it lasts for a whole week and you'll just stay mostly indoors and use masks when outside. You'll get used to it.";
