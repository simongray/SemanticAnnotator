The Scandinavian countries are among the countries in which Donald Duck is more popular than Mickey Mouse.\n\n\n> After World War II the Ehapa Verlag in Stuttgart, West Germany, a subsidiary of Danish Egmont Publishing (then Gutenberghus) started in September 1951 the monthly publication Micky Maus, a format similar to Walt Disney's Comics & Stories. From the start it featured stories by Carl Barks, translated by chief editor Dr. Erika Fuchs. The comic book was published on a biweekly basis 1956/57 and from 1958 on it changed into a weekly. Renamed Micky Maus Magazin it is still published today from the now Berlin located Egmont Ehapa publishing company and thus is the longest running German comic book. In its heyday (early 1990s) its weekly circulation number rose up to one million copies. Since then it dropped down to ca. 180.000 today.

", "I do agree with your definition of republic but I'd like to point to an interesting alternative explanation for the confusion.\n\nOne source of the confusion comes from Madison and the Federalist papers were he made the distinction between republic and democracy. See e.g. [here](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/157129/democracy/233839/Democracy-or-republic) (now gated). I would guess it is part of high school curriculum in the US which is why it pops up so often on reddit. If only they sourced it as a view from Madison used in a specific context 200 years ago it would be fine. But I guess few of them actually know that. \n\nI think Robert Dahl covers it briefly in On Democracy and says Madison diverged greatly from known usage at the time. Moden usage in academia and outside the US makes their distinction quite poor.\n\n> DEMOCRACY OR REPUBLIC? (From britannica link)\n\n\n>Is democracy the most appropriate name for a large-scale representative system such as that of the early United States? At the end of the 18th century, the history of the terms whose literal meaning is “rule by the people”—democracy and republic—left the answer unclear. Both terms had been applied to the assembly-based systems of Greece and Rome, though neither system assigned legislative powers to representatives elected by members of the dēmos. As noted above, even after Roman citizenship was expanded beyond the city itself and increasing numbers of citizens were prevented from participating in government by the time, expense, and hardship of travel to the city, the complex Roman system of assemblies was never replaced by a government of representatives—a parliament—elected by all Roman citizens. Venetians also called the government of their famous city a republic, though it was certainly not democratic.\n\n\n>When the members of the United States Constitutional Convention met in 1787, terminology was still unsettled. Not only were democracy and republic used more or less interchangeably in the colonies, but no established term existed for a representative government “by the people.” At the same time, the British system was moving swiftly toward full-fledged parliamentary government. Had the framers of the United States Constitution met two generations later, when their understanding of the constitution of Britain would have been radically different, they might have concluded that the British system required only an expansion of the electorate to realize its full democratic potential. Thus, they might well have adopted a parliamentary form of government.\n\n\n>Embarked as they were on a wholly unprecedented effort to construct a constitutional government for an already large and continuously expanding country, the framers could have had no clear idea of how their experiment would work in practice. Fearful of the destructive power of “factions,” for example, they did not foresee that in a country where laws are enacted by representatives chosen by the people in regular and competitive elections, political parties inevitably become fundamentally important institutions.\n\n\n>Given the existing confusion over terminology, it is not surprising that the framers employed various terms to describe the novel government they proposed. A few months after the adjournment of the Constitutional Convention, James Madison, the future fourth president of the United States, proposed a usage that would have lasting influence within the country though little elsewhere. In “Federalist 10,” one of 85 essays by Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay known collectively as the Federalist papers, Madison defined a “pure democracy” as “a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person,” and a republic as “a government in which the scheme of representation takes place.” According to Madison, “The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic, are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater the number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.” In short, for Madison, democracy meant direct democracy, and republic meant representative government.\n\n\n>Even among his contemporaries, Madison’s refusal to apply the term democracy to representative governments, even those based on broad electorates, was aberrant. In November 1787, only two months after the convention had adjourned, James Wilson, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, proposed a new classification. “[T]he three species of governments,” he wrote, “are the monarchical, aristocratical and democratical. In a monarchy, the supreme power is vested in a single person: in an aristocracy … by a body not formed upon the principle of representation, but enjoying their station by descent, or election among themselves, or in right of some personal or territorial qualifications; and lastly, in a democracy, it is inherent in a people, and is exercised by themselves or their representatives.” Applying this understanding of democracy to the newly adopted constitution, Wilson asserted that “in its principles, … it is purely democratical: varying indeed in its form in order to admit all the advantages, and to exclude all the disadvantages which are incidental to the known and established constitutions of government. But when we take an extensive and accurate view of the streams of power that appear through this great and comprehensive plan … we shall be able to trace them to one great and noble source, THE PEOPLE.” At the Virginia ratifying convention some months later, John Marshall, the future chief justice of the Supreme Court, declared that the “Constitution provided for ‘a well regulated democracy’ where no king, or president, could undermine representative government.” The political party that he helped to organize and lead in cooperation with Thomas Jefferson, principal author of the Declaration of Independence and future third president of the United States, was named the Democratic-Republican Party; the party adopted its present name, the Democratic Party, in 1844.\n\n\n>Following his visit to the United States in 1831–32, the French political scientist Alexis de Tocqueville asserted in no uncertain terms that the country he had observed was a democracy—indeed, the world’s first representative democracy, where the fundamental principle of government was “the sovereignty of the people.” Tocqueville’s estimation of the American system of government reached a wide audience in Europe and beyond through his monumental four-volume study Democracy in America (1835–40).", "Stort tab for de radikale.

The latter was really surprising since apparently in some organizations people in offices next to each other sometimes rarely interact if the org chart distance is high. I'd like to see similar research on the EU so that's a suggestion.\n\nFor empirical research, consider selecting a broad representation of EU institutions and collect statistics on who they interact with over a sample time period. Compare that to the organisation chart and physical distance to find discrepancies. If you want to get really fancy, such data could easily be used with social network/graph analysis. That's a very interesting field of study right now.\n\nPersonally I'd also love to see how personal relationships between key employees differ from organisational charts and physical distance.

Sure we didn't have regular office hours or an official academic advisor so if you didn't work at it you could easily be overlooked or just be \"a cog in the machine\". There is at different philosophy behind university studies in Europe (at least for Denmark which I'm familiar with) where you are treated as an adult, with the responsibilities that entails, as well expected to be in charge of your own learning. Some of it is born out of cost calculations. It is cheaper to require students to study on their own time and have limited professor-student interaction, perhaps only a couple of hours a week for a course. This philosophy has pros and cons. I'd love official office hours but I'd say I've never had a professor I wanted to get in contact with that said no.

The idea that they kick you out of your home every semester and expect you to go back to your parents for holidays is just weird to me. \n\nRegarding academic services sure some of them are nice and helpful and maybe it is a stretch to just call it all hand holding. I'd love to see open office hours and academic advisors be a formal thing here (Denmark). Still you can get the same services if you go look for them but they require you work a bit more for it. That probably means the students that most require them won't get to use them. Courses are also taught differently and I'm not sure I know what is the best method or philosophy. I was used to a system where you do a lot of the leg work yourself. You get some reading material, perhaps a few assignments during the semester and then a big exam at the end that decides your grade for the course. In the US, courses had attendance requirements, had final grades composed of a lot of, sometimes strange, tasks (like class participation) and in general required you to play a lot more by the rules set forth by the professor. Some of it I liked, e.g. it was nice to know be of the final exams that I had passed my courses due to my work during the semester. I did feel I had less freedom and flexibility to study how I wanted to though.\n\nSo yeah pros and cons but I still feel it is warranted to say that the US college experience has a bit more hand holding than in europe.", "Having been on a an exchange program for a semester at an American university I must say I really like that we don't have much hand holding at european universities.

There are countless recipes where instead of a roux you mix flour and water and add that mix to the sauce. Another popular product is to just use corn starch. Most households have a carton - even I do - to use as a thickening agent. It even comes in a version that's colored brown. The good brown sauce, with roux and red wine and stock and gastrique, have most often only been made for Christmas and similar big events.\n\nIn the last decade or so I think we have seen a trend for better cooking.

I really don't know  much of the history behind it but now I'm actually a bit curious.\n\nI don't know much about the particulars for entrepreneurs but I think generally they tend to be caught in a system that don't know how to handle them. Getting dagpenge when  you are self employed is not as easy and you are restricted in earning money/working while you receive it. There was a pilot project announced a while ago where recent graduates (who have seen higher unemployment after the financial crisis though it's got better now) could get benefits on the level of dagpenge if they sought to start their own company. For a year only I think. I don't know what happened to that. ", "I am playing fire strike so I don't need the spirit much.

", "I think some of it are misunderstandings, some of it skewed views on recent reforms and some may have a kernel of truth there. We have two levels of unemployment benefits. \n\nThe first one is a semi-public-private insurance system called dagpenge. You sign up to an a-kasse, typically they work closely with the unions (though they are legally separate), and pay a fee every month. When you get unemployed, you can claim dagpenge for 2 years for up to 90% of your pay with a max of about 18.000 DKK per month. \n\nThe second level of unemployment benefits are if you are not illegible for dagpenge, maybe because you never signed up for them or you have already received the benefits for the allowed time. If so, you can get kontanthjælp, a public unemployment benefit. You can get about 11.000 DKK per month, more if you have dependents. It's true that there are some rules about you having to use up any savings (for kontanthjælp only) and perhaps sell certain things (most likely a car if you own one) before you can receive kontanthjælp. It's not as bad as it has been portrayed some place online though. They won't go claim stuff you own in your home or some such. \n\nIn recent years we have seen some reforms of labor market policy, including dagpenge and kontanthjælp. The goal has been to get people in jobs sooner. Dagpenge used to be for 4 years (even longer if you go back a few decades). Kontanthjælp has seen some reductions in benefits paid out, e.g. for cohabiting couples it is now expected that they support each other. There are pros and cons with these changes but the reason for doing *something* makes sense (maybe the timing of the reforms so soon after the financial crisis was bad though).

We have a popular one with the casing died red, served at pølsevogne (street food sausages). Medisterpølse is a stable Danish dish, often served with gravy (brown sauce) and potatoes. It's flavored with herbs and spices and can be really nice. Most sausages are pork or pork-beef mix.\n\n\n* Personally I hate blue cheese but yeah it's something Denmark is known for. If I should choose then crumbly. \n\n\n* Rye bread Danish style is very popular. It's comparable to German Schwarzbrot but maybe even denser.

If I remember right we did at some point have the record for teen drinking, not sure if this is still the case.

Besides clubs and bars they also have a few nice places to eat. It's now possible to visit the tower of the Christiansborg, the parliament building. There is also a restaurant at the top. Papirøen has an alternative food court/high scale street food that is worth a visit.

For most other international treaties this is not the case, and without having read TPP I would think it would not formally require any formal relinquishing of sovereignty. \n\nOn the other hand, loss of sovereignty is also sometimes used (colloquially perhaps) when referring to the constraints on countries by other countries, international treaties and organizations.

The big 2.0 expansion last summer added a new act and the newest patch lots of new skills. Now we wait for a huge patch in March that will add a dungeon of sorts and allow you to unlock sub class passives. Looks really cool.", "What happens when season ends? Will they merge your paragon levels with your standard account?", "Very much looking forward to this but if you'd asked me a couple of weeks ago I wouldn't even have considered it. I got a bit tired of Path of Exile, mostly some latency issues but I also wanted a change of pace. Installed Diablo last weekend, not really having played since 2.1 I think it was, and have had a blast. Just did my first Greater Rift and that seems like something that could be fun to do. I've also started putting set items together. It's much easier now than how I remember it so even for a casual player I think it should be doable.\n\nAnyways, I'm thinking starting out new in Season 5 might be good to really get back into the game. Never done a season before. I'll probably start with a demon hunter as that was my main class before (where did dodge chance go btw?). I've only ever levelled a DH, wizard and crusader to 70 so still lots to explore I guess. I'm testing the waters right now to see what I like know. ", "That's something to consider. Oats is one of the big ones in DIY soylent though I think the original and many other producers and DIY recipes use various other things. Any idea how the impact would be for full time soylent use? How much could you safely eat and be without issues? One reason I ask is when I make my DIY soylent I do an oat base. I don't really do it much these days but 6-12 months ago I did it quite a lot. Not going full time but skipping other foods whole days at a time sometimes. Didn't really see anything out of the ordinary but I did go the extra mile and eat a lot of salad/veggies when I had the option to. ", "Horses eat oats, don't they :)\n\n(nobody knows you're horse on the internet)", "It's actually not the first time I hear about it but I must admit I didn't give much credence to the source. It seems to be a popular narrative in the organic, raw foods circles. I heard about it when overnight oats spread on the internet last fall. There are some very fancy recipes out there but really I don't think I'd like giving up the structure and bite of eating regular oats with milk. ", "Oats with milk has been a stable breakfast in Denmark for decades so I really hope not. People eat both processed \"instant style\" and coarser styles. \n\nAlso, I grew up eating a local dessert that resembles your oatmeal balls. Look it up - [havregrynskugler](http://www.food.com/recipe/havregrynskugler-cocoa-oat-coconut-balls-239443). They are very good!", "Yeah, D3 really pigeon holes you into certain skills with sets. I think one of the new sets in the next patch has a 40,000% bonus! It really just makes most legendaries kind of bland since you need the set bonuses to make an end game viable build. If PoE should add sets I really hope they don't take the inspiration from D3. \n\nRather, I like how a game maybe like Elder Scrolls Online does it. There are tons of sets, crafted and found, more on less on par but with various specializations. Sometimes it makes sense not to go for the full set bonus but mix and match. It's a very different game though so not exactly comparable.\n\nThe point of sets is to gate some special mechanics behind the need for slotting specific items. Balancing the set bonus so it makes sense for you to do that but also not require you to go for a set is hard though. Just adding more uniques that play well together might be the better path for PoE. Still, gating some item properties behind a set requirement could be made to work.", "Yeah, I think PoE has a better take on creating options for builds while still allowing a lot of variety. Set items could easily pigeon hole you into a few builds that the devs thought up. On the other hand, putting a set together might be a good goal to have for end game. I guess for PoE we need a more open-ended of uniques that work well together like the Rigwald sword/axe combo. Set bonuses could be OK too if we are talking a small number of items (D3 style 6 set bonuses are kind of too much). If they are not generally more powerful than other legendaries (besides whatever set bonus they have) I don't think they would be game breaking.\n\n", "I don't think our PM speaks anything besides Danish and English, perhaps he knows a few phrases in German and French too. And he'll be able to converse with Norwegians and Swedes of course.\n\nI think your Queen speaks a few languages besides Danish and English. French at least but I wouldn't be surprised if she has a passable German too.", "Not really a question, but I have a confession. I'm back to Diablo 3 after more than a one year break because of constant latency issues in PoE. At least for the time being (I mean, I just spent a few hours this weekend on it, that's all). There is a new patch and season coming out this week so at least I'll stay to see what that's about. \n\nSpending a few hours playing D3 this weekend did made me realize all the good stuff from PoE that I think we all take for granted. Like spending hours theory crafting your way through the passive tree and matching skill gems. D3 is kind of a kid's version of that it seems. I do like how D3 does Bounties and Rifts and would love something like that in addition to both maps and levelling. Also set items are really neat and I also like playing around with cubing legendaries for various weird effects. All in all, D3 has come a long way it seems. \n\nStill, I'd love it if latency (EU, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, you name it) would be improved. It used to be 40-60 ms and maybe have a minor spike once or twice a day. Now it's often 60-100 for long periods and spike to 2-3 times that all the time and to much higher latency every so often. And then there is the disconnects and instance not found stuff. ", "Oh, yeah that would be an interesting way to do that skill. Might be preferable to Rapid Decay in many situations or could perhaps work well together with it?", "Yeah, not very likely. \n\nWe got central registry in 1968 in Denmark and I remember some footage I saw from back then. There was a loud minority arguing against the surveillance state etc. The debate sounded very similar to how we discuss privacy and surveillance today, which I found was very interesting.", "But that's the thing, in many European countries the state would know all that (and much more) about a citizen. When an election comes up they can basically just hit print and out pops personalized voter forms that gets mailed to you with all relevant information. You bring that to you polling station as an ID. In other words, voter registration happens behind the scene based off of the information the state has already. ", "A lot of it is for practical reasons. The US doesn't have a centralized registry of all citizens like many European countries have. There are various systems that might come close like social security, IRS (taxes), driver's license, the census etc. but there is still some way to what we may be used to in Europe. ", "Hvad var det med fængsel og mord? Man kan da ikke droppe den perle uden mere info. \n\nMht billedet så har jeg for det meste hørt det omtalt som en kuriositet og noget som man kunne drille Løkke med snarere end nogen oprigtig tro på, at det var støtte til Taliban. I værste fald kan man vel beskylde ham for at være naiv, men på samme vis kan man også rose hans idealisme og at sætte ord bag handling. ", "Hvis du vil af med levebrødspolitikere så tror jeg hellere du skal se på en model hvor der er en øvre grænse på hvor lang tid man kan sidde i folketinget. Jeg tror ikke din plan om ikke at give folk løn vil løse de problemer du håber den vil. De skal jo leve af et eller andet og må få de penge et eller andet sted fra. Folk med høj indkomst eller en opsparing/formue vil have en klar fordel. Din ide om at regulere lobbyisme er fin nok, men det vil sandsynligvis betyde, at al privat støtte bliver svært. Og så er vi tilbage til, at det kun er folk som har penge i forvejen som kan blive politikere.", "Hvis du gør det ulønnet vil du da om noget gøre politikkerne til en særlig klasse løsrevet fra \"almindelige\" danskere. Det vil kun være dem som har penge til det, som kan blive folketingsmedlemmer. Det afskriver alle uden enten høj indkomst eller som har lyst til at tage mod penge fra f.eks. lobbyister. ", "It is alright I guess. We knew the track record of mtv with shows like teen wolf and it's not fair to compare it to got. Instead compared to other ya shows like merlin or the seeker it seems much better. Let's see how it develops. If it goes for teen drama and angst over a good story/plot in the next few episodes I fear the good stuff will be overshadowed.", "Godt spørgsmål. Den passer på det nordlige amager dog.", "Probably not relevant to a lot of people but HBO Nordic will have it from January 6 as well.", "Oh, then I wish you the best of luck.\n\nDo you mind me asking what degree you are pursuing?", "Just a heads up. You need to do a long series of courses in Danish to be eligible for studying in Danish at university. The final course is studieprøven I dansk. ", "A forefather of mine, Henning Hansen Rønne, was a shipowner and captain of several ships around the turn of 18th to 19th century. He was originally from the Danish island Bornholm but was based out of Copenhagen were he owned a few properties in the Nyhavn area. \n\nWe know he and, I think, a nephew of his have participated in trading with the Danish West Indies (now US Virgin Islands) and it is a not a huge stretch to argue this was at least contributing to the Danish triangular trade. Extraordinary but not very great I think.\n\nHis claim to fame is his work as a privateer in the gunboat war in the latter part of the Napoleonic wars. Denmark had lost its fleet and the government allowed private shipowners to refit ships for plundering British and other allied parties. Rønne outfitted ships of hid own and also captained at least one I think. He worked closely with other privateers from Copenhagen and Bornholm, also some of the more famous ones. \n\n\n"]
