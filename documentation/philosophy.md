Design philosophy
=================
The philosophy behind Statements is to get away from any quantitative inferences,
focusing solely on the semantics of a sentence and how closely it resembles other sentences.
This is done by extracting formal Statements from sentences that can then be compared to other Statements.

It is by design anti-quantitative and based around the concept of Resemblance.
Resemblance is a non-binary way to compare equality between Statements.
Instead of equal/not-equal, Statements resemble other Statements either fully, closely, slightly, or not at all.
This cascades down from the components of the Statement: Subjects, Verbs, DirectObjects, and IndirectObjects.
When comparing statements, the underlying components are compared and the results of the comparison
are reduced into a single resulting Resemblance.

This provides a way to search through two sets of Statements, say from two different people,
in order to find Statements where the two have expressed the same sentiment.
This is where the anti-quantitative philosophy is apparent.
Instead of doing quantitative analysis, for example attempting to find some percentage of agreement,
this kind of search gets you the exact Statements that are relevant,
as well as a way to position them in the input corpus.

This makes it the perfect approach for implementing a piece of software that is designed
to discover points of agreements between two people on social media in order to promote civil discussions.
This application, that applies some social psychology and communications theory,
displays points of agreements in real time between users on social media when they are writing to each other.
These displayed agreements then help moderate more negative replies into a more positive direction
or perhaps just delight users who will find it a funny and interesting feature.

It can also make good use of the fact that Statements can easily be composed into sentences and paragraphs.
Statements can be grouped by subject and from these groupings it is simple to compose descriptive text.
This allows for construction of a personal profile in natural language based entirely on data mining.
